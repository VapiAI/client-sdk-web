For short voicemails, there is typically 1000-2000ms of audio followed by 1200-2400ms of silence and then additional audio before the beep. Increasing the MachineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold to ~2500ms will treat the 1200-2400ms of silence as a gap in the greeting but not the end of the greeting and will result in a machine detection. The downsides of such a change include:
   * - Increasing the delay for human detection by the amount you increase this parameter, e.g., a change of 1200ms to 2500ms increases human detection delay by 1300ms.
   * - Cases where a human has two utterances separated by a period of silence (e.g. a "Hello", then 2000ms of silence, and another "Hello") may be interpreted as a machine.
   *
   * Decreasing this value will result in faster human detection. The consequence is that it can lead to increased False Human (detected human, actually machine) detections because a silence gap in a voicemail greeting (not necessarily just in short voicemail scenarios) can be incorrectly interpreted as the end of speech.
