   * - 10 can cause some missing transcriptions since because of the shorter context. This mostly happens for one-word utterances. For those uses cases, it's recommended to try 300. It will add a bit of latency but the quality and reliability of the experience will be better.

   * - Defaults to 10. This is recommended for most use cases to optimize for latency.
   * - 10 can cause some missing transcriptions since because of the shorter context. This mostly happens for one-word utterances. For those uses cases, it's recommended to try 300. It will add a bit of latency but the quality and reliability of the experience will be better.

Handoffs between agents are handled seamlessly in the background; do not mention or draw attention to these handoffs in your conversation with the user.

   * Usage:

   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "assistant",
   *           "assistantId": "assistant-123",
   *           "description": "customer wants to be handed off to assistant-123",

   *         }
   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 2.2. One Tool, Multiple Destinations (Anthropic recommended)
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "assistant",
   *           "assistantId": "assistant-123",

   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3. Dynamic destination
   *
   * 3.1 To determine the destination dynamically, supply a `dynamic` handoff destination type and a `server` object.
   *     VAPI will send a handoff-destination-request webhook to the `server.url`.
   *     The response from the server will be used as the destination (if valid).
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "dynamic",
   *           "server": {
   *             "url": "https://example.com"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3.2. To pass custom parameters to the server, you can use the `function` object.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [

   *         }
   *       ],
   *       "function": {
   *         "name": "handoff",
   *         "description": "Call this function when the customer is ready to be handed off to the next assistant",

   *               "enum": ["dynamic"]
   *             },
   *             "customerAreaCode": {
   *               "type": "number",
   *               "description": "Area code of the customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerIntent": {
   *               "type": "string",
   *               "enum": ["new-customer", "existing-customer"],
   *               "description": "Use new-customer when customer is a new customer, existing-customer when customer is an existing customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerSentiment": {

   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The properties `customerAreaCode`, `customerIntent`, and `customerSentiment` will be passed to the server in the webhook request body.

For short voicemails, there is typically 1000-2000ms of audio followed by 1200-2400ms of silence and then additional audio before the beep. Increasing the MachineDetectionSpeechEndThreshold to ~2500ms will treat the 1200-2400ms of silence as a gap in the greeting but not the end of the greeting and will result in a machine detection. The downsides of such a change include:
   * - Increasing the delay for human detection by the amount you increase this parameter, e.g., a change of 1200ms to 2500ms increases human detection delay by 1300ms.
   * - Cases where a human has two utterances separated by a period of silence (e.g. a "Hello", then 2000ms of silence, and another "Hello") may be interpreted as a machine.
   *
   * Decreasing this value will result in faster human detection. The consequence is that it can lead to increased False Human (detected human, actually machine) detections because a silence gap in a voicemail greeting (not necessarily just in short voicemail scenarios) can be incorrectly interpreted as the end of speech.

   * This is the plan to extract variables from the tool's response. These will be accessible during the call and stored in `call.artifact.variableValues` after the call.
   *
   * Usage:
   * 1. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body. (Most common case)
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{customer.name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{customer.age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The tool response body is made available to the liquid template.
   *
   * 2. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body if the response is an array.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * $ is a shorthand for the tool's response body. `$[0]` is the first item in the array. `$[n]` is the nth item in the array. Note, $ is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 3. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response headers.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * `tool.response` is made available to the liquid template. Particularly, both `tool.response.headers` and `tool.response.body` are available. Note, `tool.response` is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 4. Use `schema` to extract a large portion of the tool's response body.
   *
   * 4.1. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "string"
   *       },
   *       "age": {
   *         "type": "number"
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}` and `{{ age }}` respectively. To emphasize, object properties are extracted as direct global variables.
   *
   * 4.2. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": {"first": "John", "last": "Doe"}}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "object",
   *         "properties": {
   *           "first": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           },
   *           "last": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}`. And, `{{ name.first }}` and `{{ name.last }}` will be accessible.
   *
   * 4.3. If you hit example.com and it returns `["94123", "94124"]`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "array",
   *     "title": "zipCodes",
   *     "items": {
   *       "type": "string"
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This will be extracted as `{{ zipCodes }}`. To access the array items, you can use `{{ zipCodes[0] }}` and `{{ zipCodes[1] }}`.
   *
   * 4.4. If you hit example.com and it returns `[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "zipCodes": ["94123", "94124"]}, {"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "zipCodes": ["94125", "94126"]}]`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "array",
   *     "title": "people",
   *     "items": {
   *       "type": "object",
   *       "properties": {
   *         "name": {
   *           "type": "string"
   *         },
   *         "age": {
   *           "type": "number"
   *         },
   *         "zipCodes": {
   *           "type": "array",
   *           "items": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This will be extracted as `{{ people }}`. To access the array items, you can use `{{ people[n].name }}`, `{{ people[n].age }}`, `{{ people[n].zipCodes }}`, `{{ people[n].zipCodes[0] }}` and `{{ people[n].zipCodes[1] }}`.
   *
   * Note: Both `aliases` and `schema` can be used together.

   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "assistant",
   *           "assistantId": "assistant-123",
   *           "description": "customer wants to be handed off to assistant-123",
   *           "contextEngineeringPlan": {
   *             "type": "all"
   *           }
   *         },
   *         {
   *           "type": "assistant",
   *           "assistantId": "assistant-456",
   *           "description": "customer wants to be handed off to assistant-456",
   *           "contextEngineeringPlan": {
   *             "type": "all"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3. Dynamic destination
   *
   * 3.1 To determine the destination dynamically, supply a `dynamic` handoff destination type and a `server` object.
   *     VAPI will send a handoff-destination-request webhook to the `server.url`.
   *     The response from the server will be used as the destination (if valid).
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "dynamic",
   *           "server": {
   *             "url": "https://example.com"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3.2. To pass custom parameters to the server, you can use the `function` object.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "dynamic",
   *           "server": {
   *             "url": "https://example.com"
   *           },
   *         }
   *       ],
   *       "function": {
   *         "name": "handoff",
   *         "description": "Call this function when the customer is ready to be handed off to the next assistant",
   *         "parameters": {
   *           "type": "object",
   *           "properties": {
   *             "destination": {
   *               "type": "string",
   *               "description": "Use dynamic when customer is ready to be handed off to the next assistant",
   *               "enum": ["dynamic"]
   *             },
   *             "customerAreaCode": {
   *               "type": "number",
   *               "description": "Area code of the customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerIntent": {
   *               "type": "string",
   *               "enum": ["new-customer", "existing-customer"],
   *               "description": "Use new-customer when customer is a new customer, existing-customer when customer is an existing customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerSentiment": {
   *               "type": "string",
   *               "enum": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"],

   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The properties `customerAreaCode`, `customerIntent`, and `customerSentiment` will be passed to the server in the webhook request body.

  /**
   * This is the plan to extract variables from the tool's response. These will be accessible during the call and stored in `call.artifact.variableValues` after the call.
   *
   * Usage:
   * 1. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body. (Most common case)
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{customer.name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{customer.age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The tool response body is made available to the liquid template.
   *
   * 2. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body if the response is an array.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * $ is a shorthand for the tool's response body. `$[0]` is the first item in the array. `$[n]` is the nth item in the array. Note, $ is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 3. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response headers.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * `tool.response` is made available to the liquid template. Particularly, both `tool.response.headers` and `tool.response.body` are available. Note, `tool.response` is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 4. Use `schema` to extract a large portion of the tool's response body.
   *
   * 4.1. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "string"
   *       },
   *       "age": {
   *         "type": "number"
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}` and `{{ age }}` respectively. To emphasize, object properties are extracted as direct global variables.
   *
   * 4.2. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": {"first": "John", "last": "Doe"}}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "object",
   *         "properties": {
   *           "first": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           },
   *           "last": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}`. And, `{{ name.first }}` and `{{ name.last }}` will be accessible.
   *
   * 4.3. If you hit example.com and it returns `["94123", "94124"]`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "array",
   *     "title": "zipCodes",
   *     "items": {
   *       "type": "string"
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This will be extracted as `{{ zipCodes }}`. To access the array items, you can use `{{ zipCodes[0] }}` and `{{ zipCodes[1] }}`.
   *
   * 4.4. If you hit example.com and it returns `[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "zipCodes": ["94123", "94124"]}, {"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "zipCodes": ["94125", "94126"]}]`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "array",
   *     "title": "people",
   *     "items": {
   *       "type": "object",
   *       "properties": {
   *         "name": {
   *           "type": "string"
   *         },
   *         "age": {
   *           "type": "number"
   *         },
   *         "zipCodes": {
   *           "type": "array",
   *           "items": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * This will be extracted as `{{ people }}`. To access the array items, you can use `{{ people[n].name }}`, `{{ people[n].age }}`, `{{ people[n].zipCodes }}`, `{{ people[n].zipCodes[0] }}` and `{{ people[n].zipCodes[1] }}`.
   *
   * Note: Both `aliases` and `schema` can be used together.

   * This is the plan to extract variables from the tool's response. These will be accessible during the call and stored in `call.artifact.variableValues` after the call.
   *
   * Usage:
   * 1. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body. (Most common case)
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{customer.name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{customer.age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The tool response body is made available to the liquid template.
   *
   * 2. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response body if the response is an array.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{$[0].age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * $ is a shorthand for the tool's response body. `$[0]` is the first item in the array. `$[n]` is the nth item in the array. Note, $ is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 3. Use `aliases` to extract variables from the tool's response headers.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "aliases": [
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerName",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-name}}"
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "key": "customerAge",
   *       "value": "{{tool.response.headers.customer-age}}"
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * `tool.response` is made available to the liquid template. Particularly, both `tool.response.headers` and `tool.response.body` are available. Note, `tool.response` is available regardless of the response body type (both object and array).
   *
   * 4. Use `schema` to extract a large portion of the tool's response body.
   *
   * 4.1. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": "John", "age": 30}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "string"
   *       },
   *       "age": {
   *         "type": "number"
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}` and `{{ age }}` respectively. To emphasize, object properties are extracted as direct global variables.
   *
   * 4.2. If you hit example.com and it returns `{"name": {"first": "John", "last": "Doe"}}`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "object",
   *     "properties": {
   *       "name": {
   *         "type": "object",
   *         "properties": {
   *           "first": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           },
   *           "last": {
   *             "type": "string"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * These will be extracted as `{{ name }}`. And, `{{ name.first }}` and `{{ name.last }}` will be accessible.
   *
   * 4.3. If you hit example.com and it returns `["94123", "94124"]`, then you can specify the schema as:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "schema": {
   *     "type": "array",
   *     "title": "zipCodes",
   *     "items": {
   *       "type": "string"
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *

   *           "description": "customer wants to be handed off to assistant-123",
   *           "contextEngineeringPlan": {

   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3. Dynamic destination
   *
   * 3.1 To determine the destination dynamically, supply a `dynamic` handoff destination type and a `server` object.
   *     VAPI will send a handoff-destination-request webhook to the `server.url`.
   *     The response from the server will be used as the destination (if valid).
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [
   *         {
   *           "type": "dynamic",
   *           "server": {
   *             "url": "https://example.com"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * 3.2. To pass custom parameters to the server, you can use the `function` object.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "tools": [
   *     {
   *       "type": "handoff",
   *       "destinations": [

   *           },
   *         }
   *       ],
   *       "function": {
   *         "name": "handoff",
   *         "description": "Call this function when the customer is ready to be handed off to the next assistant",

   *               "enum": ["dynamic"]
   *             },
   *             "customerAreaCode": {
   *               "type": "number",
   *               "description": "Area code of the customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerIntent": {
   *               "type": "string",
   *               "enum": ["new-customer", "existing-customer"],
   *               "description": "Use new-customer when customer is a new customer, existing-customer when customer is an existing customer"
   *             },
   *             "customerSentiment": {

   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The properties `customerAreaCode`, `customerIntent`, and `customerSentiment` will be passed to the server in the webhook request body.
